# PageScroll Re-Enabler
PageScroll Re-Enabler is a chrome extension that tries to re-enable the possibility to scroll by mouse-wheel on websites, where this is not possible.

# Prerequisites
- Chrome **must** be at least version 22 (but I hope for the sake of the internet that your browser is a hell of a lot more up-to-date)
