# PageScroll (Re-)Enabler

Did you encounter websites, where scrolling using the mousewheel etc. wasn't possible at all and you had to manually drag the scroll bar?  
This extension takes care of this annoying behaviour!

An example page where I encountered this problem (might be already solved by today): https://starwars.ea.com/

The extension can easily be disabled via the icon besides the URL bar (e.g. if problems with it occur). And it can be enabled the same way again of course.
